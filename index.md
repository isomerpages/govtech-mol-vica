      description: AlphabotSG is a super chatbot that learns from various agency chatbots, so that we can help you with a range of common matters and resources in just one place. When you ask a question, it finds the best answer from the most relevant agency. If there isn't a confident answer by any agency, it gives you the best possible response using the context of the interaction and a new large language model.
