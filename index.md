      title: It gets the best answer from the most relevant agency
      description: AlphabotSG always asks its sister chatbots to find out which is
        more confident to answer you relevantly, so you don't need to search
        multiple websites to get one thing done.

      title: It contextualises the chat between you and itself
      description: AlphabotSG remembers the previous chat messages between you and
        itself, so that the continued interaction is more relevant. This context
        will only be active until the chat session is closed.

      title: It understands longer and complex messages
      description: AlphabotSG utilises a new large language model to generate the best
        possible reply in case no other agency chatbots can reply confidently.
        Depending on the nature of the question, it may give you a concise or
        elaborate response, chooses to not answer, or asks a follow up question.

        on messaging
      subtitle: Every effort counts
      description: AlphabotSG may not always give you an answer you're expecting, so
        we'd like your help to tell us where you think is acceptable or not.
        Thank you for your generosity in helping Singapore to build a smarter
        nation and be able to assist citizens who prefer getting help beyond a
        website.
