### It gets the best answer from the most relevant agency

AlphabotSG always asks its sister chatbots to find out which is more confident to answer you relevantly, so you don't need to search multiple websites to get one thing done.

### It contextualises the chat between you and itself

AlphabotSG remembers the previous chat messages between you and itself, so that the continued interaction is more relevant. This context will only be active until the chat session is closed.

### It understands longer and complex messages

AlphabotSG utilises a new large language model to generate the best possible reply in case no other agency chatbots can reply confidently. Depending on the nature of the question, it may give you a concise or elaborate response, chooses to not answer, or asks a follow up question.
