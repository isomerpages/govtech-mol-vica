### About AlphabotSG

At [VICA](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/vica/), we aspire to create a simple and natural experience for citizens at different life stages to interact with government services.

This is why we launch an innovative virtual assistant to do just that. For the first time, it is capable of understanding lengthy or complex messages. Either it picks a confident answer from a linked agency, or it gives you a concise or personalised response by itself.

We are always committed to improve the contextual understanding of AlphabotSG and bring clear and simple government services to you. So give it a try today!
