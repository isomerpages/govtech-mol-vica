---
Meet **AlphabotSG**, the Singapore Government’s chatbot engineered by GovTech's conversation AI platform [VICA](https://www.tech.gov.sg/products-and-services/vica/), to learn from various agency chatbots and help citizens and residents with a range of common matters and resources.

#### Gets the best answer from the most relevant agency

AlphabotSG always asks its sister chatbots to find out which is more confident to answer you relevantly.

#### Contextualises what you have said

AlphabotSG remembers the previous chat messages between you and itself, so that the continued interaction is more relevant. This context will only be active until the chat session is closed. 

#### Understands longer and complex queries

Alphabot utilises a new large language model to generate the best possible reply in case no other agency chatbots can reply confidently. Depending on the nature of the question, it may give you a concise or elaborate response, chooses to not answer, or asks a follow up question.
